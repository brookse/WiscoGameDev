# How to contribute
If you'd like to add to this repository, you can do so in the following ways:

1. If you have a github account, then this definitely the easiest way to contribute.
  - In order to contribute, you'll need to do a typical 'Pull Request' or submit a github issue. There are [many](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-on-projects-using-pull-requests/)  [resources](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for help on how to do this online.
  - Though the above resources can explain how to submit a pull request better than I can, I can attempt to describe what you'll need to do here. 
    - Click on the name of the file that you wish to change in the github file browser (for the main list, that will be README.md). 
    - Then, when you're looking at the file directly, you will be able to edit it on the site directly, since it is a [markdown (.md)](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) file. To do this, click the little pencil 'edit' button in the top right. You'll be able to make changes in markdown format. 
    - When you're done, write a description of your changes, and propose those file changes using the box and button at the bottom. 
    - Now, you'll be brought to the 'pull request' page. Double check that your changes are good, and then click Create Pull Request.
    - This will bring you to another description section, where you can describe your pull request. It will probably be the same as what you wrote for your previous description. Then, after making sure the description is good, you can 'create pull request'. You'll then be brought to a screen that shows your active pull request. In order for your changes to be integrated with the page, this pull request will need to be approved by an admin of the page to make sure it doesn't break anything. After that is done, your changes will be reflected!
  - :bangbang: NOTE :bangbang:: If you're uncomfortable with submitting a pull request, you can create a github 'issue' instead (no technical expertise is required to do this). You can do that by selecting the 'Issues' tab above, and somebody else will make the change for you. This is a lot easier for most people than submitting a pull request, since you just have to fill out a dialogue box with the information you'd like to add, as well as a 'tag' if you wish. The downside to this change, is that it may take longer to integrate the change because somebody else will have to actually change the file to reflect your changes.

2. If you don't have a github account, here are some alternative ways to get your changes in.
  - Consider creating a github account and using the above options (submitting an issue is very simple. No technical expertise required!)
  - Join the [Madison Game Dev Slack](https://madisongamedev.slack.com/messages/gamedev/) and request your change there.
  - Join the [Madison Indies Page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/madisonindies/) and request your change there.
  - If all of these options fail, consider tracking me down and asking me in person. I'm generally not a hard person to find :sunglasses:
